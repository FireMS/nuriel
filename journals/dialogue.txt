- what’s up?

- i don’t really know.

- could you try to describe it?

- i just feel like i’m not comfortable with myself. like i don’t really have a true sense of identity or belonging.

- your lack of identity is a very loaded circumstance, why do you feel that is?

- i can’t figure that out, i feel worthless. as all the value i had is gone, and all that’s left is a husk of what represents a human being. i want to be real, i want to be somebody, it’s just that i’m so afraid of change, yet it’s all i ever crave.

- why are you so afraid of it? of all people, you should understand the importance of change. why do you lie to yourself?

- i don’t know. i live in ignorance and dismiss my emotional and mental flaws because i can’t stand the fact that i’m not the secure, modest person i want to be. i understand the importance of emotions, and i’m a very emotional person, yet i still can’t find it in me to move on. i know that life is about imperfection, and i shouldn’t strive to be perfect, i get that. it’s just, this state, this state of uncertainty and self delusion, it isn’t living, this isn’t life.

- to me it sounds like you do know, you’re just scared of doing anything about it, so you’d rather hide from it. whether it’d be by some facade that you can’t persist with, or distracting yourself. regardless, you know it’s unhealthy.

- yeah, i do, but change is easier said than done. you don’t just get up off your ass one day and change everything about yourself, and what you thought you were, that’s just not how it works. it’s a matter of rebuilding everything that i once saw to be true, habits i’ve adopted in pursuit of validation and approval, making a true transition to adulthood, not wallowing in a childhood i was robbed of, accepting the idea that those i loved are gone, moving on from the times i was taken advantage of, learning to deal with my schizophrenia, all while managing to love the world and everyone in it, while still not being naive.

- throwing a pity party for yourself won’t change anything. you’ve made it apparent you’ve been through a lot, dwelling on the past won’t do anything for you. everyone goes through hardship, you’re not special, if you want change, you have to do something about it.

- i know, it’s just a lot, you know? i have a lot on my plate as it is. i hate being seen as an example or voice of reason when i’m not rational enough to be truthful to myself, nor make great decisions. i have my regrets, and i reflect on them much more than i should. i always find myself asking for one more chance.
