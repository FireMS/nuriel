what if you’re so guarded now that you’ve cut yourself off from potential happiness?

if you’ve already given your heart away, then why bother trying to give your heart to anybody ever again?

there’s a thin line between protecting yourself and making it impossible for anyone to get close to you.

the fact that you were so willing to reveal so much to me without hesitation shows how starved you are of a meaningful connection.

you’re grasping desperately for the chance of real human contact.

you’re only in tune with what you’re willing to feel, you’re repressing the more painful ones.

you won’t give into anger or allow enough sadness to cry, the only emotions you’re in tune with are the ones you deem safe enough to feel. the ones that let you stay in control of yourself.

- i can’t tell if i’m too scared to be vulnerable, or if i’m too caught up in my pride to admit it.

no matter how deep you delve into introspection, you’re gonna get things wrong, you’re gonna miss details, and inevitably, your pride will obscure things, and you even won’t even realize it

i know that it’s hard, but please have faith in yourself. even after everything, faith can make impossible seem possible if nothing else will.
